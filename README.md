- **Taryn_ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb**: Part 1 of code - Crowdfunding data and pledging categories/subcategories data. For this section, Excel data was converted to a pandas DataFrame, the data type was checked and columns were split into lists and exported into a csv file for further analysis.

- **Sameer_Hooda_ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb**: Part 2 of code - Dataframe containing clean campaign information<br> For this section, we copied the crowdfunding dataframe into campaign dataframe. After that we renamed the blurb,launched_at and deadline columns. Converted the datatype of goal and pledged columns. After that change the format of the date in launched_date and end_date and merged the dataFrame with category and sub category dataframe and exported as a csv file.

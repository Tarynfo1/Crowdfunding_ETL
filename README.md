# Crowdfunding Extract, Transform and Load project
***<br>
<br>
In this project an ETL pipeline was built using Python, Pandas and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform data of a crowdfunding dataset containing information on supporters and their pledging details to fund various personal campaigns and projects. This was converted to csv files and Python was used to extract and transform the data while SQL was used to load and query.
